## Task01 - Indexed Image

In the folder `python` you can find files for a simple Python program.
There are no further project files provided.

### Run the Project
To run the program it should be enough to run `main.py`

The assignment in the eLearning system provides a file `data.dat`.
Place this file next to `main.py` and run the program from *the
same location*. The program loads the file and generates a new file, that you
should upload to pass the assignment.
