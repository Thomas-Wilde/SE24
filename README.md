## Task01 - Indexed Image

In the folder `task01/java` you can find files for a Java program.
There are no project files provided. You could either:

1. Compile the program by hand using `javac Logger.java` followed by
   `javac Generator.java`, or
2. create a project using your preferred IDE and add the files.

### Run the Project
The assignment in the eLearning system provides a file `data.dat`.
Place this file next to the executable and run the program from *the
same location*. The program loads the file and generates a new file, that you
should upload to pass the assignment.

If you use an IDE and run the program from that IDE, make sure to configure the
correct working directory and place the file `data.dat` in this working
directory. Otherwise the program will fail to load the files and eventually
throw an exception.
