# SE24 -- C++ Version
Repository for the course "Software Engineering &amp; IT-PM" at the university Magdeburg.

## Task01 - Indexed Image

In the folder `c++` you can find files for a C++ project.
A `CMakeLists.txt` is provided, so if you want, you can create a project for
the IDE of your choice using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

### Run the Project
If you compile the project you will find an executable.
The assignment in the eLearning system provides a file `data.dat`.
Place this file next to the executable and run the program from *the
same location*. The program loads the file and generates a new file, that you
should upload to pass the assignment.
